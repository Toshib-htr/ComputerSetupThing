## Description
An automated computer setup program (__Windows__ only), made when I really didn't want to deal with setting up and logging many different computers.  
  
This program names the computer, logs the MAC address and manufactuerer detials (S/N, Model Number, Model Name), and puts them into a .csv file  

## Building  
Built using Visual Studio Community 2015, should work with later versions as long as the latest .NET Framework is installed.  

## Config File
Config file synatx can be found on the wiki (as soon as I get it up)

## Running
Just run the compiled executable with a config file present (again, I need to get the documentation up first)

## Future Updates
v1.1: Allow for custom configs and output file names
v1.2: Setup a default configuration file
v1.3+: I dunno
